# Prime Number Checker

This script checks if a given number is a prime number.

## Description

The script defines a function `is_prime(number)` that determines whether a number is prime. It then prompts the user to enter a number and uses the `is_prime` function to check if the number is prime, printing the result to the console.

There is no input validation, and no "Play again" loop.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The script will output whether the number is a prime number or not.
